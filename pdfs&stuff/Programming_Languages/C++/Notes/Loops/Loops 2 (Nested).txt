in nested loops like the example, 
the variable inside of the nested loop resets each time that loop ends and the main loop runs again

Example 1
-------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
   int n = 3;
   for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
   {
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j += 2)
      {
         cout << i << ' ' << j << ' ';
      }
   }
   cout << endl;
   return 0;
}


OUTPUT: "1 1 2 1 3 1 3 3 "
for i=0
for i=1  ^^^^
for i=2      ^^^^
for i=3		 ^^^^
for i=3		     ^^^^


when i = between 0-2
the inner loop runs once each time
on the i=3
there is output twice
the inner loop runs twice because 1 is <= 3 && also the second time 3 is <= 3
