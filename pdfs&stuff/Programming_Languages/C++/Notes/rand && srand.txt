random numbers
use the <cstdlib>
=====================================================
rand();
// produces a random integer between 0 and RAND_MAX

rand() %n;
//produces a random integer value between 0 and n
	e.g.
	rand() % 6;  // the output is between 0,1,2,3,4,5

rand() %n + m;
//produces random number betweeen m and n
	e.g.
	rand() % 6 + 1;  // the output is between 1,2,3,4,5,6

srand(num);
// seeds rand() with integer
// num should be a non-negative integer. A program that should behave identically on every run can use a constant seed


srand (time (0));
//A program whose behavior should change on each run itself needs a random number for the seed
// srand seeds the rand ( ) list by using the local time on the computer. 
// Since the time is measured in tiny fractions of seconds, the rand ( ) list appears to be random each time.
// uses <ctime> library and <cstdlib> library
