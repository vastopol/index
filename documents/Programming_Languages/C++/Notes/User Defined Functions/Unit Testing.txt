Unit testing is the process of individually testing a small part or unit of a program, typically a function.
A unit test is typically conducted by creating a testbench, a.k.a. test harness, 
which is a separate program whose sole purpose is to check that a function returns correct output values for a variety of input values.
Each unique set of input values is known as a test vector.

The language provides a compact way to print an error message when an expression evaluates to false. 
assert() is a macro (similar to a function) that prints an error message and exits the program if assert()'s input expression is false. 
The error message includes the current line number and the expression (a nifty trick enabled by using a macro rather than an actual function). 
Using assert requires first including the <cassert> library
