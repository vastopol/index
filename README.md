overview of my work &amp;&amp; resources

Windows is not a good platform for easily programming.
Using dual boot, most of my coding is done on linux.

only use windows for: dyalog apl, matlab, atmel studio, eclipse

eclipse is buggy, prone to crashes, difficult to properly setup and configure on linux.

need windows to use atmel studio, unless you make your own build chain.
